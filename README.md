# fortnite-structs
```diff
So first lets dump all fortnite structs
# HOW ?
```
- First install a fortnite ue viewer & decryptor like VMmodel
- second search structs in the FORTNITE-BINARIES-22.pak and copy the entire content of it
- after go to a ue decryptor and put the content -> copy the decrypted content and paste it to a HEX VIEWER like HxD
- finally save the content as C ARRAY and you will get the new structs on your pasteboard
```
